# ECE387---BikeGameFinalProject-

Hello this is our bike project. 
To set up the circuit, we used six buttons and an "Infrared Slotted Optical Optocoupler Module Speed Measuring Sensor". 
The six buttons we put on pins 2-7, 7 was reserved for the button to change scheme used to change the controls.
The other five buttons are for controlling the game. The IR speed sensor is what we used to measure the speed of the bike. 

All of the code need is located in Bike_Control_Final.ino. We used three librarys which are Keyboard.h, KeyboardLayout.h, and Mouse.h.
The libraries is what we used to change the Ardunio input into keyboard inputs for our game.
The libraries are only compatable with a certain microprocessor which is why we used the Arduino Leonardo which contained this microprocessor.
The Arduino Leonardo was difficult to find so we used an off-brand which was compatable with the Leonardo code. 

Other than that all we needed was a bike and a stationary stand to hold the bike to attatch the sensors to.
We could then attach the arduino to a computer which we had an app called Blue Stacks in order to play the andriod games like Subway Surfers.

The Final Report can be seen in the wiki section under the "Report" labeled pages.
